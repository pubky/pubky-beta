        Except for excluded claims described in the paragraph below, Synonym and you each agree that any dispute, claim

        interpretation or validity thereof, (ii) Platform; (iii) your Content or (iii) your use of the Platform at any
        time, will be subject to and finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration on an individual basis and
        not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. If you are a Person subject to the
        jurisdiction of the United States of America, the interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration
        provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. Arbitration will be conducted
        through the use of videoconferencing technology (unless both parties agree that an in-person hearing is
        appropriate given the nature of the dispute) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules. The
        sole arbitrator must be a legal practitioner in the El Salvador with at least fifteen (15) years of experience
        in commercial disputes, that holds a current practising certificate. If an arbitrator cannot be jointly
        appointed by the arbitration parties within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the arbitration, an
        arbitrator meeting the above qualifications will be selected by the International Institute for Conflict Prevent
        and Resolution. Judgement upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having
        jurisdiction thereof. If the arbitral parties do not promptly agree on the seat of arbitration if an in-person
        hearing is selected, the seat will be El Salvador. The language of the arbitral proceedings will be English. No
        discovery shall be conducted except by agreement of the parties or after approval by the arbitrator, who shall
        attempt to minimize the burden of discovery. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
        jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by Laws, and the arbitral decision may be
        enforced in court. For claims less than U.S.$15,000, Synonym will reimburse you for all initiating filing fees
        in the event that the claim is successful. The prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator, will be
        entitled to its costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator’s fees) and its reasonable attorney’s fees

        agreement. This authority extends to jurisdictional challenges with respect to both the subject matter of the
        dispute and the parties to the arbitration. Further, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the
        existence, validity, or scope of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of
        challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, each clause in this section will be considered as separable
        from any contract of which it forms a part. Any challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, except
        challenges based on the award itself, will be made not later than the notice of defense or, with respect to a
        counterclaim, the reply to the counterclaim; provided, however, that if a claim or counterclaim is later added

        No Waiver; Available Remedies:
      </Typography.Body>
      <Typography.Body className="text-opacity-80" variant="medium-light">
        Any failure by Synonym to exercise any of its rights, powers, or remedies under these Terms, or any delay by
        Synonym in doing so, does not constitute a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. The single or partial
        exercise of any right, power, or remedy by Synonym does not prevent either from exercising any other rights,
        powers, or remedies. The remedies of Synonym are cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
        by the provisions of these Terms, or by law or equity. You agree that the remedies to which Synonym is entitled
        include (i) injunctions to prevent breaches of these Terms and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
        hereof, and you waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such remedies, (ii) the right
        to recover the amount of any Losses by set off against any amounts that Synonym would otherwise be obligated to
        pay to you, and (iii) the right to seize and recover against any of your assets, or your interests therein, that
        are held by Synonym or any of its Associates.

      <Typography.Body className="text-opacity-80" variant="medium-light">
        These Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are not assignable
        by you without prior written consent of Synonym and any attempt by you to assign these Terms without Synonym’s
        written consent is void. These Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained herein, are
        freely assignable by Synonym, in whole or in part, without notice or your consent (for clarity, this assignment
        right includes the right for Synonym to assign any claim, in whole or in part, arising hereunder). Any attempt
        by you to assign these Terms without written consent is void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms, and any of
        the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, shall be binding upon and inure to the
        benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, personal or legal representatives, successors and assigns of
        you and of Synonym. None of the provisions of these Terms, or any of the rights, duties, and obligations
        contained or incorporated herein, are for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of you or Synonym or
        any other persons, except: (i) such as inure to a successor or assign in accordance herewith; and (ii) that the
        Associates of Synonym are intended third party beneficiaries of the rights and privileges expressly stated to
        apply to the Associates hereunder and shall be entitled to enforce such rights and privileges (including those
        rights and privileges set out in the paragraph titled “Responsibilities, Limitation of Liability and Indemnity”)
        as if a direct party to these Terms. No consent of any Person is required for any modification or amendment to
        these Terms.
